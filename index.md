# About Me
I’m a PhD student at the Doctoral School of Humanities, University of Warsaw. I’m also a member of <a href="http://kognilab.pl/wordpress/en/laboratory-of-experimental-philosophy-kognilab/">Laboratory of Experimental Philosophy „Kognilab”</a>.

My research interests include metaphilosophy, epistemology, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of cognitive science. In particular I’m interested in the role of intuitions in the philosophical methodology, the relation between philosophical methodology and methodology of science and the concept of a priori knowledge. What connects all of the above is a big question about the impact of the cultural background to the results of philosophical and scientific activity.
