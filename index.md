# About me


I’m a PhD student at the Doctoral School of Humanities, University of Warsaw. I’m also a member of <a target="_blank" href="http://kognilab.pl/wordpress/en/laboratory-of-experimental-philosophy-kognilab/">Laboratory of Experimental Philosophy „Kognilab”</a>.

My research interests include metaphilosophy, epistemology, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of cognitive science. In particular I’m interested in the role of intuitions in the philosophical methodology, the relation between philosophical methodology and methodology of science and the concept of a priori knowledge. What connects all of the above is a big question about the impact of the cultural background to the results of philosophical and scientific activity.

# Current Projects


## Methodological naturalism and the theory of reference
In my doctoral project I try to determine whether, and if so, to what extent methodological naturalism can be seen as a proper approach to the theory of reference. In order to reach that aim I am analyzing the so-called “intuition-talk” within the theories of reference and whether naturalistic stance on the nature and the epistemological role of intuition fits the role of intuition within the theories of reference. I am heading that project under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://odrowazsypniewska.wixsite.com/home">Joanna Odrowąż-Sypniewska”</a> and Katarzyna Kuś. It is financed by Polish National Centre of Science (NCN) (2021-2024, under the “Preludium” program, total funding 118,000PLN/~31,000$)

## Universality or specificity of folk epistemology? Methodological consequences for cognitive science and analytic philosophy
This project has two aims. First one is to determine whether folk epistemologies are universal or culturally specific. In order to reach that goal I am conducting a metaanalysis of the research from the field of experimental philosophy, developmental psychology and cultural anthropology on the differences in folk epistemologies. The second aim is to analyze possible methodological consequences of the results reached during the first stage of the project. In the second part of the project I analyze the most important stances on the role of folk opinions and intuitions in epistemology, and the most important stances that aimed to merge the studies on folk epistemologies conducted within experimental philosophy, developmental psychology and cultural anthropology. I'm heading that project under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://kpaprzycka.filozofia.uw.edu.pl/">Katarzyna Paprzycka-Hausman”</a>. It is financed by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (2018-2022, under the “Diamond grant” program, total funding 177,000PLN/~47,000$)
